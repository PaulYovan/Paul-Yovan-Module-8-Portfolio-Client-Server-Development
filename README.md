# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The way I ensure that programs are maintanable, readable, and adaptable is by ensuring that I have well-commented code that makes the code easy to interpret for updatability by someone that might not be myself.

# Consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way?
The benefits of working the way I did was when I faced a challenge with my code, it didn't take me too long to find a solution to the problem that I was facing by using other people's experiences with the error code I was facing and how they fixed it and then applying what I learned to my own code.

# How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I could use this CRUD Python module in the future in the event that I have to work with a database which would be likely as most companies use a database and updating the module to fit in with the database that I'm working with.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach a problem as a computer scientist by first seeing if the error that I'm facing can easily be explained by the engine I'm using to run the code and if that doesn't work I'll try to use my previous experiences and seeing if I can apply that to the problem I'm facing to fix the problem, and then finally if that doesn't work I'll search up the error I'm facing to see if someone else has encountered the issue I have and applying what I learned from what they were told to my own code.

# What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I would definitely use the technique that I use for coding in the future due to the use of well-commented code to make the code make sense to other users that may possibly use it. I would also use the same strategy I used when facing a problem in the future to create databases to meet client requests as the startegy I used helped solve my issues relatively quickly.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists help code software that helps benefit the company they're working for. This matters because without computer scientists, it would be very difficult to advance in technology due to what computer scientists create.

# How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
My work would help Grazioso Salvare do their work better by making an easy-to-use database that is very user-friendly and helps the company easily sort the animals within their database and see the location of that animal on the map which not only helps them find the animal's information faster than before but also the exact location of the animal.
